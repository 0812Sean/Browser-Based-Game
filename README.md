## Different browsers have different default styles, to ensure the style is consistent across all browsers, I used this code in my CSS.
```
* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}
```

## Move The Snake:
Because the first element of the snake array is always the snake head, the snake's movement effect can be achieved by using ```snake.unshift(head)``` to add a new snake head position at the beginning of the array and using ```snake.pop()``` to remove the last element at the end of the array (when no food is eaten).

## Make the snake move on its ownï¼š
Making the snake move by itself is an important step in the snake game. I used a timer (setInterval) and the "update" function to achieve this operation, and let the increase in score increase the speed of the snake.
```
let speed = 200
        if (score % 50 === 0) {
            speed = Math.max(50, speed - 20);
            clearInterval(gameInterval);
            gameInterval = setInterval(gameLoop, speed);
        }
```

## Future Improvements
- Adding levels of difficulty.
- Make a score leaderboard.
- Enhancing the game with sound effects and additional animations.
